# Progress: Screenshot Link

*   **What Works:**
    *   Core capture (full screen, crop).
    *   PNG saving to Google Drive.
    *   Drive authentication & token handling.
    *   Setting "anyone with link" permissions.
    *   Opening uploaded file.
    *   Keyboard shortcut configuration.
    *   Options page (method, Drive folder URL).
    *   Drive folder URL validation & UI feedback.
*   **What's Left / Potential Improvements (Speculative):**
    *   More robust error handling (Drive API).
    *   Testing (unit/integration).
    *   Review "page" capture method.
    *   UI/UX refinements.
    *   Handling edge cases (network errors).
    *   Updating vendored libraries.
